# SpaceshipScheduler

See the current schedule of Spaceships coming to your station or add your own spaceship and see when it arrives next.

This project was made using Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, GoogleFonts, and MomentJS to keep track of time. This project stores the data in a database from Google Firebase, so if you add a spaceship you can see what others have added and your spaceship will still be there if you open it from a different computer.
